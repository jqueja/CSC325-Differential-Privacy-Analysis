# Data Analysis Project for Hogwarts Students

## Overview
At the Ministry, we are conducting a data analysis project tailored for the students of Hogwarts. This initiative uses differential privacy to safeguard individual privacy while uncovering meaningful trends and insights. By introducing controlled noise into the results, we ensure that no specific student's information can be identified, fostering trust and maintaining confidentiality. This method strikes a balance between protecting privacy and preserving data utility, enabling the secure sharing of aggregated insights.
