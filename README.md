# Data Analysis Project for Hogwarts Students

## Overview
At the Ministry, we are conducting a data analysis project tailored for the students of Hogwarts. This initiative uses differential privacy to safeguard individual privacy while uncovering meaningful trends and insights. By introducing controlled noise into the results, we ensure that no specific student's information can be identified, fostering trust and maintaining confidentiality. This method strikes a balance between protecting privacy and preserving data utility, enabling the secure sharing of aggregated insights.

## Installation

To get started with the project, you'll need to set up a virtual environment and install the
required dependencies. Follow the steps below to set up your environment.

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

Ensure that you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system.
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

### 2. Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
source /venv/bin/activate
```
You should notice a change in your terminal prompt. It should now display (venv) at the beginning, indicating that the virtual environment is active.
